# cpp_genetic
This is a generic cpp library that performs genetic search with any data stucture that contains a copy constructor and iterator (like `vector` or `list`). By using iterators, the code will quickly copy and breed different data sets. 

## Using
**TODO**


## Testing
The code auto runs tests with google cloud build. Will be tested with standard library data structures of `vector` and `list`. It should also work with `C++ array`(but not C arrays as they don't have iterators). It will be tested with number types `char`, `unsigned char`, `short`, `unsigned short`, `int`, `unsigned int`, `long`, `unsigned long`, `long long`, `float`, `double`, and `long double`.

## Why
This is a side project to learn the new conding conventions in C++11. My main job is as an embedded C programmer. I plan on using this library to find the best stratagies for playing Settlers of Catan.
